## TextRank: Bringing Order into Texts
> A graph-based ranking model for text processing. 

### TextRank Model
The basic idea implemented by a graph-based ranking model is that of "voting" or
"recommendation". When one vertex links to another one, it is basically casting a vote for 
that vertex. 

The higher the number of votes that are cast for vertex, the higher the importance of 
the vertex.
