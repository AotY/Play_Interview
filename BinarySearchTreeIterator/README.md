## 173. Binary Search Tree Iterator

Implement an iterator over a binary search tree (BST). 
Your iterator will be initialized with the root node of a BST.



Calling next() will return the next smallest number in the BST.


Note: next() and hasNext() should run in average O(1) time and uses O(h) memory, 
where h is the height of the tree.
