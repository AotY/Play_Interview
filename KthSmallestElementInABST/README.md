## 230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST
> Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it.
  
  Note: 
  You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.

```html
Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
   3
  / \
 1   4
  \
   2
Output: 1
```

```html
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
       5
      / \
     3   6
    / \
   2   4
  /
 1
Output: 3
